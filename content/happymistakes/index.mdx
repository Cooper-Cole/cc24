I make pour over coffee every morning.

It’s the best part of my morning and one I consider a non-negotiable.

The recipes I brew are ones I’ve perfected (to my liking) over days of trial and error.

One morning I started the timer for the 30 second bloom on my coffee and got distracted tending to my mushroom log.

_For the non-coffee nerds: Blooming your coffee is adding water (usually 2x the amount of ground coffee) to release carbon dioxide before brewing. This is a typical step in brewing pour over coffee._

When I remembered my coffee, the bloom was at 2 minutes.

I felt annoyed because I thought I had ruined my coffee.

But I continued brewing anyway, not wanting to waste the beans I’d gotten from Japan.

To my surprise, the brew was sweeter and full-bodied.

It tasted like I was drinking a completely different coffee.

How could this be so good?

I tried a 2 minute bloom with another coffee.

Again, I got a sweeter cup that I enjoyed much more than my standard recipe.

I now bloom each of my brews for 2 minutes.

It was something I would have never learned if I hadn’t made this mistake.

This was a reminder that mistakes aren’t all bad.

It’s what we take from them that helps us grow.

This was a happy mistake. I make better coffee because of it.

And I hope to apply this to other aspects of my life.

Rather than getting bent out of shape because I made a mistake.

Instead, I can give myself some grace and see what I learn from it.
