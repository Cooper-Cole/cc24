Hi, I'm Cooper.

I like gaming, hi-fi sound, coffee, the outdoors, and reading.

My day job is in venture where I get to see founder's dreams come true and witness the birth of new and exciting technology. I've been a data-driven program manager for 5 years focused on using data to work efficiently and drive business results.

I write about whatever comes to mind.
