Yes is the most overused word in my vocabulary. I say yes to almost anything a friend or colleague needs. Pet sitting, time consuming and out of scope work requests, hang outs that I don’t want to attend.

*Why do I say yes so much?*

Because I want to be seen as someone reliable and interesting. But being reliable and saying yes aren’t mutually exclusive. 

In November 2023, I found myself with a severe traumatic brain injury that impaired my cognition, balance, and memory. I was a (barely) walking shell of the person I was just 24 hours prior.

I had to stop everything.

No work, video games, exercise, screen time, music, or reading. I laid in bed coming in and out of sleep for 24 hours a day for the first week.

As I got better, I spent hours a day writing in my journal. Any thought that came to mind was written down and I’d explore it.

My thoughts became clearer each day. I felt in tune with my mind and body for the first time.

One day I sat down and made a list of the things I liked. I revisited this list constantly throughout my 10 week recovery. The list decreased each time I went back to it. What I ended up with was a list of things I genuinely enjoyed.

*Reading, alone time, hanging with my girlfriend, long walks, playing video games, yoga, journaling, painting, and deep learning.*

The realization crept in that there were things I thought I loved but I was just doing out of habit.

One item in this list was a volunteer role I’d been doing for three years. The joy I once felt for the role was gone and replaced with frustration over internal politics and stalled activities.

Why do something that frustrates me? I dreaded returning to it. So I'm stopping.

With more free time available, I signed up for an art class so I could paint more. Painting wasn’t a hobby I had before the concussion. I fell in love with it during my recovery. And now I’m making the time to paint by cutting out the activities that don’t make me think [“hell yeah.”](https://sive.rs/hellyeah)

Reflect on how you spend your time. Be honest with yourself. What you learn may surprise you.
